# MPLAB-CODES

This repository contains multiple PIC microcontroller programs written in C and developed using MPLAB.

It includes practical examples such as LED blinking, switch interface, single and two-digit seven-segment display, DC motor control, 4-bit LCD interface, ADC, 4x4 keypad, timers, interrupts, UART, and PWM.

Each project folder provides the C source code (.c file). Users can open the code in MPLAB, build the project with a suitable compiler, and generate the HEX file if required for simulation or hardware testing.

These codes serve as a useful reference for students and beginners to learn and practice fundamental PIC microcontroller programming concepts in MPLAB.
